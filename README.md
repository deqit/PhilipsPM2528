# Reviving a Philips PM2528 Digital Multimeter
Picked up this vintage multimeter a while back — half-functional, no manuals, and full of mystery. Perfect.

It’s built around an Intel 8035 microcontroller and packed with analog boards. There wasn’t a complete service manual anywhere, so I decided to dive in myself. This project's become a learning experience in hardware reverse engineering, firmware disassembly, and documentation.

Note: Everything you find here is a work-in-progress. It might be incomplete, and some parts may not be 100% accurate — yet. If you spot something interesting or catch an error, feel free to drop me a message. I’ll gladly update the info and give credit where it’s due.

I’ll be sharing the repair process, schematics as I recreate them, and whatever interesting quirks I uncover along the way. If you’re into old test gear, 8-bit micros, or just enjoy seeing how stuff ticks — follow along.

Have fun!
Dethmer.
